# Final Project: Option 2
The goal of this project was to create a program that will predict the next 3 characters in a sentence using any language. The dataset has a maximum time limit of 30 minutes to load, and must contain multiple languages. After the user chooses the i​​th character, the system should choose the top 3 candidates for the (i ​ ​+ 1)th character as quickly as it can.

## Installation
Install dependencies with `pip install`:
* `keras`
* `tensorflow`

## Running
Run `python FinalProject.py` from the root project directory to run the application

## Usage
After starting the program, it will take about 25-30 minutes to train, depending on the specifications of the users computer.
Once the program is finished training, it will prompt the user in the console to type in characters and then submit.
Once it is submitted, the console will then print out the predicted next 3 characters.
